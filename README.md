# N-Queen-Visualizer
How it Works :
The program uses backtracking to solve the N-Queens problem. It places queens on the board, 
checks if the current configuration is valid, and recursively tries all possibilities. 
If a valid solution is found, it is displayed on the board using different colors.
Required Package : Pygame
Usage:
1.The application window will open, displaying an empty chessboard.
2.Left-click on the chessboard to start the visualization process of solving the N-Queens problem.
3.The program will find a valid solution and display it on the board.
Note: To change the number of queens (N) to place on the board, modify the ROW variable in the nqueen.py file.
